                    Sunk under the sea the sun blazing above - scorching white sands that cover a metropolis - Which one? Does it even matter? Let's just - say you may not get to use that coupon - on a product of equal or lesser value Just - forget about it: the strolls in the park's - well kept lawn, the evenings abroad year in and year out, - the ease of a conversation with a stranger, - the glow of an incandescent light bulb in a winter storm - But hey! Think not of what you have lost - but of what you have not lost as the - currents stir something deep within you - a kind of rage or is it glee? - It's hard to tell those apart - when you've seen too - much and gone blind"

                    Old and abandoned who will care for you now in your state - of decrepitude? What a shiny new idea they said - as they patted you in the back and polished your - edges But what is this? Progress they - call it And you realize oh my god - How long has this been going on? And you - begin to understand your place - in this hamster wheel world But little one - what of the open field and wild grass - beneath your belly full of non pellet - food fueling your aimless wanderi - ngs bounded only by your cowardice - and lack of imagination Why not seek the seas - though you may starve or - perish some other horrible way will you - beg for your comforts then?"

                    Lone was I a single traitor in the sky - a man in a 48 hour whirlwind of treachery caught in a metal - tube in the sky but hey at least there are free - pretzels or at least there are supposed to be where are - those salty, crunchy nuggets of distraction in this - cornucopia of angst and conflict some call 'my life' I mean - how do we even know its mine? Maybe some other person ran this - sack of flesh to this current predicament? If only we could go - back in time and find out who is responsible - But lets not kid ourselves time is a slippery devil, but - it only goes forward westward upward into that - sea of possibility called the Minneapolis International Airport (MSP for short, because let's not spend those precious seconds of our lives - saying what we mean when we could be panicking about the battery - level on our phones, dreading the moment when we have no means to instagram - our food and are left alone with ourselves)"

                    Softly they implored from me a temporary - and aimless momentum I was afraid, naturally Like it - was too good to be true, like I was sure to squander - this golden moment and it's sparkling magic - Like I was going to look back later and say What!?!? Whoa !?!? What!?!? Why!?!? How did you - Why!?!? In a fury I did what - was best or at least something that seemed very much - like it Like I was playing myself in a - movie where there was not doubt only purpose - and every shot is well framed and lit and sounds are all - crisp and clean, every moment follows the last - flawlessly and consciousness glides - through space creating reality or at least - something that seems very much like it - for as long as the medium allows"

                    Dark and dimly lit looming above an endless valley - and an even more vast horizon a moment holds you - still A light tug pulling in all directions, reassuring, terrifying, - a taste of death perhaps or immortality Is this - what objects feel as they whitness - us flash by ever concerned with translucent - motion seeking anything that can be called - meaning who cares what it really is, what is important - is what we believe The truth never - lulled anyone to bed or even the grave for that - matter We haven't much time Life is brief Our vision - must be vast and clear as unleaded tap water - It must inspire sensations we didn't know we had - to do god knows what Let us prove - that we are alive Let us escape banality - Then stillness awaits We do not care for it   "
